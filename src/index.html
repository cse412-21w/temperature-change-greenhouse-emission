        <h2>Temperature Change and Greenhouse Emission Over Years</h2>
        <p>One of the most important issues the world and all world citizens face is the climate
          change in this technological era. The record of historical temperature change provides
          us the chance to show how it progresses over times at various time periods in different
          countries and also overall world temperature change. Carbon emission is one of the main
          causes of climate change that is worth more attention, so we want to show people the
          current situation to raise awareness and call for actions for possible reduction in
          carbon footage so that we can contribute as much as we can to save the world.
          We plan to use global maps to present an overall distribution of both greenhouse
          gas emissions and temperatures. By choosing two years with a long-time span,
          we can see which countries have the most greenhouse gas emissions.
          We intend to use an interactive line to present the greenhouse emission
          and temperatures of countries around the world. From this, we may be able to display
          the relationship between greenhouse emission and temperature changes. We will present
          the meterological year temeprature change over years by a bar chart. Also, we would
          like to do deep research on the reasons behind some noticeable changes and present
          the reasons to the audience.

        <h3>Total Greenhouse Gas Emission in Top Countries with Pollutant Proportion (incomplete):</h3>
        <div id="overall-bar"></div>
        <p>
          <b>Idea</b>: When changing the year as dragging the slider, we would see the bar chart corresponding to that year.
              For each country, the bar is shown with pollutant proportion with different colors. (The slider is not
              working now, and I will revise it later...) <br>
          <b>Interpretation</b>: United States has the highest total greenhouse gas emission. An generic observation for each
              country is that carbon dioxide is in the greatest proportion among total gas emission, and methane
              is at the second. So for the rest of analysis, we have filtered the pollutant type into these
              two kinds of gases.
        </p>
        <h3>Embed a Vega-Lite Visualization:</h3>
        <p>The following interactive graph shows the average emission of carbon dioxide
          from year 1990 to 2018, and the changes of temperature for each year. By using the
          selection bar, one could simply see the average emission of carbon dioxide and temperature
          changes of a particular country. It is notable that most of countries experienced a growth
          in temperature during these year.

        <h3>How much does the world temperature change from year to year</h3>
        <div id="d3"></div>
        <p>
          It is getting hotter!
          The bar chart shows how much is the meterological temperature change from baseline
          between 1962 and 2018. Negative number means that this year's temperature is lower
          than the baseline temperature, and positive number means higher temperature
          The overall trend is that the temperature steadily increases from year to year.
          Starting from 1997, there is no longer a flunctuation on temperature changes,
          and temperature is higher by about 2 degree celcius compared to the baseline temperature.
