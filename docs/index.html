        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          One of the most important issues the world and all world citizens face is the climate
          change in this technological era. The record of historical temperature change provides
          us the chance to show how it progresses over times at various time periods in different
          countries and also overall world temperature change. Carbon emission is one of the main
          causes of climate change that is worth more attention, so we want to show people the
          current situation to raise awareness and call for actions for possible reduction in
          carbon footage so that we can contribute as much as we can to save the world.

        <h3>Greenhouse Gas Emission Proportions in Top Countries</h3>
        <p>
          Greenhouse gas is mainly composed by Carbon Dioxide, Methane, and Nitrous Oxide. More information can be
          checked in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas">this Wikipedia page</a>. Within this 20
          years, the proportion of carbon dioxide increases among those countries, whereas that of methane decreases.
          <br><br>
          From the dataset between 1990 and 2018, even though there are some missing country data, United States
          has the highest greenhouse gas emission in every year. Throughout this 20-year span, alomost every country
          increases the gas emission, whereas a few countries such as Germany and United Kingdom have a downward
          trend.
          <br><br>
          British parliament passed <b>Climate Change Act</b> in 2008, and the United Kingdom became the
          <b>first country</b> in the world that published legislation to handle climate change. Recently, more
          and more countries have paid increasing attention on greenhouse gas emission and climate change, especially
          solving carbon emission.

        <h3>Emission Of Greenhouse Gases</h3>
        <p>
          Carbon Dioxide, methane, and Nitrous oxide, are three major components for greenhouse gases. And
          they are the one of the significant causes of the global warming. Following graphs display the flunctuation
          of three gases during 1990 to 2018. We can observe that these three gases all have an incresing trend around
          year 2017.

        <h3>Carbon Dioxide Emission And Temperature Changes of Each Country</h3>
        <p>
          The following interactive graph shows the average emission of carbon dioxide
          from year 1990 to 2018, and the changes of temperature for each year. By using the
          selection bar, one could simply see the average emission of carbon dioxide through out the years and temperature
          changes of a particular country. It is notable that most of countries experienced a growth
          in temperature during these year. Note: Lost some countries when joining two datasets.

        <p>
          The trend for temperature change for each country varies between years.
          However, it is noticeable that countries in more developed area has larger changes compared with
          those in less developed countries.

        <p>
          The overall Trend is that the temperature steadily increases from year to year.
          Starting from 1997, there is no longer a flunctuation on temperature changes,
          and temperature is higher by about 2 degree celcius compared to the baseline temperature.

        <h3>Insight</h3>
        <p>
          Human-induced climate change has contributed to changing patterns of extreme weather
          across the globe, from longer and hotter heat waves to heavier rains. While we were
          developing a more well-rounded understanding about how greenhouse gases affect global
          warming, it is notable that greenhouse gas emissions, mainly carbon dioxide and methane,
          continue to increase and the gap between current trends and agreed climate targets has widened.
          Through this project, we hope to remind people that greenhouse gases from human activities are
          the most significant driver of observed climate change since the mid-20th century and as greenhouse
          gas emissions from human activities increase, they build up in the atmosphere and warm the climate,
          leading to many other changes around the world—in the atmosphere, on land, and in the oceans. These
          changes can have negative effects on people, society, and the environment—including plants and animals
          and these changes can last for a very long period.
