        <p>
          One of the most important issues the world and all world citizens face is the climate

          change in this technological era. The record of historical temperature change provides
          us the chance to show how it progresses over times at various time periods in different
          countries and also overall world temperature change. Carbon emission is one of the main
          causes of climate change that is worth more attention, so we want to show people the
          current situation to raise awareness and call for actions for possible reduction in
          carbon footage so that we can contribute as much as we can to save the world.
<<<<<<< HEAD
          We plan to use global maps to present an overall distribution of both greenhouse
          gas emissions and temperatures. By choosing two years with a long-time span,
          we can see which countries have the most greenhouse gas emissions.
          We intend to use an interactive line to present the greenhouse emission
          and temperatures of countries around the world. From this, we may be able to display
          the relationship between greenhouse emission and temperature changes. We will present
          the meterological year temeprature change over years by a bar chart. Also, we would
          like to do deep research on the reasons behind some noticeable changes and present
          the reasons to the audience.

        <h3>Greenhouse Gas Emission Proportions in Top Countries</h3>
        <p>
          Greenhouse gas is mainly composed by Carbon Dioxide, Methane, and Nitrous Oxide. More information can be
          checked in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas">this Wikipedia page</a>. Within this 20
          years, the proportion of carbon dioxide increases among those countries, whereas that of methane decreases.
          <br><br>
          From the dataset between 1990 and 2018, even though there are some missing country data, United States
          has the highest greenhouse gas emission in every year. Throughout this 20-year span, alomost every country
          increases the gas emission, whereas a few countries such as Germany and United Kingdom have a downward
          trend.
          <br><br>
          British parliament passed <b>Climate Change Act</b> in 2008, and the United Kingdom became the
          <b>first country</b> in the world that published legislation to handle climate change. Recently, more
          and more countries have paid increasing attention on greenhouse gas emission and climate change, especially
          solving carbon emission.

        <h3>Emission Of Greenhouse Gases</h3>
        <p>
          Carbon Dioxide, methane, and Nitrous oxide, are three major components for greenhouse gases. And
          they are the one of the significant causes of the global warming. Following graphs display the flunctuation
          of three gases during 1990 to 2018. We can observe that these three gases all have an incresing trend around
          year 2017.

          It is getting hotter!
          The bar chart shows how much is the meterological temperature change from baseline
          between 1962 and 2018. Negative number means that this year's temperature is lower
          than the baseline temperature, and positive number means higher temperature
          The overall trend is that the temperature steadily increases from year to year.
          Starting from 1997, there is no longer a flunctuation on temperature changes,
          and temperature is higher by about 2 degree celcius compared to the baseline temperature.

        <h3>Insight</h3>
        <p>
          Human-induced climate change has contributed to changing patterns of extreme weather
          across the globe, from longer and hotter heat waves to heavier rains. While we were
          developing a more well-rounded understanding about how greenhouse gases affect global
          warming, it is notable that greenhouse gas emissions, mainly carbon dioxide and methane,
          continue to increase and the gap between current trends and agreed climate targets has widened.
          Through this project, we hope to remind people that greenhouse gases from human activities are
          the most significant driver of observed climate change since the mid-20th century and as greenhouse
          gas emissions from human activities increase, they build up in the atmosphere and warm the climate,
          leading to many other changes around the world—in the atmosphere, on land, and in the oceans. These
          changes can have negative effects on people, society, and the environment—including plants and animals
          and these changes can last for a very long period.
